Magic Themed RPG Plugin for Spigot

This plugin is moreorless a sandbox to me. When I think of a new way something could be programmed into the game, or a new way an ability could be used, I'll make it 
here.

Interesting features:
	Elytra-Gliding: enhanced flying machanics
	AoE Magic Gems: magic gems which have applied effects when dropped on the ground
	*Chat-based Casting: cast magic by chatting while holding a special book
	Totems: same effects as Magic Gems, but are fixed structures made of blocks.
	**Transmutation Circles: draw floor patterns out of redstone, can be used to reassemble matter [1]

* = Inconvenient mechanic, subject to change
** = The detection system for Transmutation Circle is clunky, and deserves a rewrite

[1] will write soon
